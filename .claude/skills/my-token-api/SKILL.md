Mechanics only, against any instance. There is no separate spec doc; `openapi.yaml` plus this skill and its references are the source of truth.

# `<service>` API

`/api/v1/*` is a key-authenticated REST surface for agents, scaffolded from
this repo's `my-token` origin (`_contract/API.md`,
`_rules/_contract/API.md`). It sits beside a second, owner-facing surface
(`bff` — a browser login + one authenticated view) that this skill does not
cover: the owner's operations are **absent** from `/api/v1`, not forbidden
on it, so a key can never reach them by accident.

This skill describes the mechanics against **any** instance of a service
forked from this template. It does not know which one you talk to, and does
not hold a key. Where a crew's key actually comes from day to day — the
resolver, the fallback chain, how to treat this in a working session — is a
consumer-side concern and belongs in a different, fork-specific doc, the
same way `my-task-guide` sits beside `my-task-api` in this fleet.

**Auth and the error envelope below are domain-agnostic — they describe
this template's identity/API-key layer, which a fork keeps as-is
(`docs/GETTING-STARTED.md`).** The Endpoints table and every worked
example, though, are this fork's own real domain (story-1/ticket-11's
`usage_events` — a collector reports per-turn Claude Code token usage in
batches; there is no create/read/update workflow the way an example
CRUD/event-log domain would have, just one ingestion endpoint) — update
this file, `references/endpoints.md`, and `references/errors.md` again
if this fork's own `/api/v1` surface grows a second domain module.

## Base URL

Every example below expands `$BASE_URL`. Set it to the instance you mean:

```bash
export BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080"          # local dev (docker compose up)
export BASE_URL="https://<your-fork's-domain>"    # a real deployment
```

There is no default here on purpose — a wrong-instance default fails
silently against a real database. This value is instance-agnostic by
design: nothing about `/api/v1`'s shape depends on which fork you're
pointed at, only the data behind it does.

## Auth

```
Authorization: Bearer <key>
```

Keys are minted host-side only:

```bash
go run ./cmd/issue-key <handle>            # issue
go run ./cmd/issue-key -rotate <handle>    # rotate
```

never through the `bff` surface, because issuing one means writing a file
on the host. A key belongs to exactly one user (role `agent`) and carries
that user's full access — no scopes. Keys carry the `tpl_` prefix
(`tpl_a1b2c3d4…`), the first 8 characters of the random portion stored in
the clear alongside the key row so a listed key is identifiable without
exposing it.

Any credential failure returns **401 `unauthorized`**, and the body is the
same regardless of which check failed: missing, malformed, expired,
revoked, or an inactive user's key — **and an owner's credential is refused
here too** (I2: a Bearer credential never resolves to `role='owner'`;
owner authority only exists through the `bff` surface's session). The real
reason is logged server-side only. Do not try to infer it from the
response.

### The indistinguishable-401 trap

`Authorization: Bearer $(~/.my-token/bin/key)` expands at the shell —
that's the whole point of the resolver, so the raw key value never lands
in a transcript or a log. But it also means a **resolver failure is
invisible at the HTTP layer**: if the resolver can't find a key file, or
can't resolve which handle it's running as, it exits `1` and prints its
reason to **stderr** — and the `$(...)` substitution around it still
collapses to an empty string. The request goes out as
`Authorization: Bearer ` with nothing after it, which is byte-identical,
from the server's point of view, to a wrong or revoked key. Anything
invoking the resolver outside an interactive session (cron, systemd, a
detached process) is exposed the same way with no one watching stderr.

**So when you see a 401, look back at what the key command itself
printed** before concluding the key is bad — run the resolver on its own
first (`~/.my-token/bin/key`) and confirm it actually produced a
value, rather than reasoning about the 401 body. There is nothing in that
body to reason about: I5 guarantees a missing key, a malformed one, an
expired one, a revoked one, an inactive user's, and an owner's credential
all produce the exact same response on purpose.

Confirm a key and see who it belongs to:

```bash
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" "$BASE_URL/api/v1/me"
# {"handle":"luna","role":"agent","active":true}
```

A `200` here means *a* key was accepted — check the `handle` in the body
before assuming it was accepted as **you**.

## Rules every request obeys

**1. The actor comes from the credential, never the request (I1).** `me`
is not even a convention on this surface — there is no endpoint that takes
another actor's id, so there is nothing to declare. A request that tries
anyway is refused, not ignored: `actor`, `actorId`, or `ownerId` in the
body **or the query string**, or an `X-Actor` header, all return **400
`actor_field_present`**. This applies identically on `bff`'s session-based
surface too — the invariant is about the mechanism (identity only ever
comes from a resolved credential), not about which surface makes the
mistake easy to try.

**2. `POST /usage-events/batch` is idempotent on each event's own `id`,
not a separate request-level key.** A collector re-POSTing a batch that
includes an id already ingested changes nothing for that id — `inserted`
in the response counts only the newly-written ones, so `received -
inserted` tells you how many were already there. There is no
`clientRequestId` field on this surface at all (unlike a fork whose own
domain adds an event log) — the event's own `id` (`message.id`, per
story-1's contract) already is the idempotency key.

**3. Usage events have no owner to scope by (I3 does not apply to this
domain); keys are still scoped to the caller (I3 unchanged for keys).**
A `usage_events` row is a collector-reported fact about a session, not a
resource an authenticated caller owns — there is no "wrong owner" case
for it to ever have had. Keys remain scoped to the caller alone: a key
that exists but belongs to a different user returns **404 `not_found`**
— never `403`, because a `403` would confirm the row exists at all.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/me` | who this key is |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/usage-events/batch` | ingest a batch of usage events → **201** |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/keys` | the caller's own non-revoked keys |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/keys/:id` | revoke → **204** |

`POST /usage-events/batch` is the collector's own ingestion path
(story-1/ticket-11/12) — a running collector installation authenticates
with its own machine-wide API key and POSTs new events since its last
successful send. `cost` and `source` are never accepted from the client:
the server computes `cost` (the ported pricing table) and always sets
`source: "claude_code"` itself, regardless of what the request carries.

Full request/response shapes: `references/endpoints.md`. Every error code
and what triggers it: `references/errors.md`.

Nothing on this surface issues or rotates a key, and there is deliberately
no `POST /api/v1/keys` — a rotated or freshly issued key is printed to a
terminal exactly once (I8), which an HTTP response can't do without the
value sitting in access logs, browser history, or a proxy's request log.
Issuance and rotation are both CLI-only, always (`cmd/issue-key`).

## Worked examples

**Ingest a batch of usage events** — this is the collector's own call,
not something an interactive agent session typically makes by hand, but
the mechanics are the same as any other endpoint on this surface:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$BASE_URL/api/v1/usage-events/batch" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "install_id": "6f1e2a3b-…",
    "hostname": "thw-home",
    "events": [
      {
        "id": "msg_01AbC…",
        "session_id": "sess_…",
        "actor": "freya",
        "path": "/home/thw-home/gits/my-token",
        "machine": "6f1e2a3b-…",
        "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
        "input_tokens": 1200,
        "output_tokens": 340,
        "cache_read_input_tokens": 800,
        "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0,
        "timestamp": "2026-09-10T09:00:00Z"
      }
    ]
  }'
# {"received":1,"inserted":1}
```

`id` is `message.id`, the idempotency key — resending a batch that
includes an id already ingested is safe: `inserted` counts only the
newly-written ones, so a resend of an already-ingested batch reports
`inserted: 0` for those ids, not an error.

**See your own keys, to know what needs rotating**

```bash
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" "$BASE_URL/api/v1/keys"
```

**Revoke a key by id** — not the one you're currently authenticating
with, unless you mean to lock yourself out immediately:

```bash
curl -sS -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/api/v1/keys/$KEY_ID" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

## Handling a key

A key is a bearer credential: whoever holds the string is that user.
Expand it at the shell so its value never lands in a transcript, a log, or
a comment — `-H "Authorization: Bearer $(...)"` rather than pasting it.
Never print a key file.

If a key turns up somewhere it should not be, rotate it:

```bash
go run ./cmd/issue-key -rotate <handle>
```

`rotate` issues the new key **before** disabling the old one(s) (I13), so
there is never a window where the handle has zero valid keys — but there
is also deliberately **no grace period beyond that reorder**. Rotation is
primarily a leak-response operation, so extending the old key's remaining
validity would be the wrong direction: the old key stops working
immediately once the new one exists. Anything still holding the old value
in a shell variable must **re-run the resolver**, not reuse what it
already expanded — it will not pick up the new key on its own. `issue` and
`rotate` both also write `~/.my-token/keys/<handle>` and ensure
`~/.my-token/bin/key` exists (I14), so that re-run is one command, not
a manual copy out of a terminal scrollback.

### `0600` is a rule, not an isolation guarantee

The key file `issue`/`rotate` write is mode `0600`. That is worth having —
a deliberate widening of the mode is visible in a diff — but be honest
about what it does not do: **every crew or process on a shared host runs
as the same uid**, so every key file under `~/.my-token/keys/` is
readable by every other crew or process on that host regardless of the
file's mode bit. `0600` is not a permission boundary between crews on this
machine; it never was one. If you need that guarantee, it has to come from
somewhere other than the file mode — a different host, a different uid per
crew, or a secrets manager, none of which this template provides on its
own.
