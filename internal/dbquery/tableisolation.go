// Package dbquery is a small, non-domain helper package — a sibling of
// internal/api, internal/db, and internal/platform, all living directly
// under internal/ rather than internal/domain/ (internal/architecture_
// test.go's domainModuleNames only ever looks under internal/domain/, so
// none of these need excluding by name the way milestone-1's version had
// to) — that holds the single implementation behind every domain module's
// own I4 ("one seam reads identity" / "one repo, one table") check.
//
// Before task-8, internal/todo and internal/identity each had their own
// near-duplicate copy of this check
// (assertQueriesReferenceOnlyTable/assertQueryFileReferencesOnlyTables),
// and both hardcoded the *other* module's table name(s) as the forbidden
// list: internal/identity's hardcoded "todos", internal/todo's hardcoded
// "users"/"api_keys". Once a fork deletes the todos table and adds its own
// (e.g. snippets), internal/identity's check keeps forbidding a table that
// no longer exists and passes vacuously — proven directly: a test agent
// added `SELECT * FROM snippets;` to db/queries/users.sql and the "table
// isolation" check still passed, because it only ever checked for the
// literal string "todos". This package fixed that first pass by deriving
// the forbidden-table set dynamically from db/queries/*.sql itself, by
// scanning every other file's content — but a scan-and-guess derivation
// cannot tell a legitimate cross-module *read* from an ownership claim,
// which is exactly the bug milestone-4 found: db/queries/todo_events.sql's
// ListTodoEventsFeed legitimately JOINs users (for the cross-todo feed's
// actor handle/role), and the scan attributed "users" to todo_events.sql
// as if it owned it — which then made users.sql's own, real, "FROM users"
// look like a violation of someone else's ownership.
//
// milestone-4's second pass replaces derivation with an explicit,
// hand-maintained source of truth (TableOwnership, ReadOnlyGrants) —
// same trade the scope-tags fix already made elsewhere this milestone:
// explicit and correct over automatic and wrong. No file is ever scanned
// to guess what it owns; ownership is declared once, and a table with no
// declared owner is a build error, not a silent pass.
