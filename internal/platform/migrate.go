// Migrate applies every pending goose migration in db/migrations (embedded
// at build time via migrations.FS, not read off disk) to db. It is safe to
// call on every process start — goose tracks applied versions in its own
// bookkeeping table and skips anything already applied — which is what
// lets `docker compose up` bring the service up against a fresh, empty
// SQLite volume with no separate migrate step (GOAL.md Done-when 8):
// cmd/server calls this before serving any request, and cmd/issue-key
// calls it too so the one-off key-seeding command works even against a
// volume the server hasn't started against yet.
//
// This is the same migration set and the same goose.Up call
// this function's own test (migrate_test.go,
// TestGooseUp_FullMigrationSetAppliesCleanly) and bin/goose (Makefile,
// docs/DEPLOY-REQUIREMENTS.md) apply — embedding just changes where the
// *.sql bytes come from, not what gets run.
