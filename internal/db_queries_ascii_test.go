// Package internal — a floor for a real, reproduced sqlc bug:
// bin/sqlc v1.31.1 (pinned in go.mod) corrupts its own star-expansion
// byte offsets when a db/queries/*.sql file contains any non-ASCII byte
// (not just an em dash — task-1's own report first found this with an em
// dash, a real fork (DLV-1) later hit the identical corruption with "§"
// and with Thai prose, and story-1/ticket-16 independently re-hit the
// same em-dash case by hand while editing a query file's comment, caught
// immediately by this exact test). The failure mode is actively
// misleading: sqlc reports a syntax error naming a token that appears in
// no file ("mismatched input 'SELECd'") at a line number that is not
// where the non-ASCII byte actually is, and the corruption can cascade
// into unrelated queries later in the same file. A comment warning this
// away only reaches whoever happens to open the one file it was written
// in — this template's own convention (em-dash prose, Thai rulings
// quoted verbatim) makes every db/queries/*.sql file an equally likely
// place to reintroduce it. This check reaches the population a comment
// can't: anyone editing any file under db/queries/, whether or not they
// ever open the file the bug was first found in.
//
// Removal condition, stated so this doesn't outlive its own cause and
// turn into folklore nobody can justify deleting: remove this check once
// go.mod pins a github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc release past v1.31.1 that no
// longer corrupts star-expansion byte offsets on non-ASCII input in
// db/queries/*.sql — verify against that release the same way this file
// was verified against v1.31.1 (a controlled repro: add non-ASCII above a
// star-expansion query, confirm sqlc generate no longer mangles it)
// before deleting, not on the assumption a version bump alone fixed it.
// Until then, this is a real, live cost worth naming plainly: no Thai, no
// em dash, no other non-ASCII byte in any db/queries/*.sql comment, in a
// repo whose own working language is partly Thai. That's the right trade
// today, against a pinned, known-bad tool version — not a permanent
// statement about what this repo's comments may say.
