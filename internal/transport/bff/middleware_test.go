// the cookie Secure attribute must be derived from cfg.AuthAudience's
// scheme, not hardcoded. This directly
// covers the bug that broke มายด์'s own first login attempt — an
// http://localhost AuthAudience (GETTING-STARTED.md's documented local-dev
// setup) must produce Secure=false, since Safari refuses to store a Secure
// cookie over plain http. A real (always-https) deployment must still get
// Secure=true, unaffected by this change.

		// refuse to set any cookie while configured(cfg) is false, which
		// an empty AuthAudience always implies).
