// This file was rewritten wholesale for milestone-4/task-6 (I21), not
// patched in place. The previous version's shared fixture,
// newBFFRouterForTwoOwnersWithKeys, seeded two role='owner' users and
// called repo.CreateAPIKey on them directly — bypassing cmd/issue-key, the
// only real code path that ever produces a role='agent' user with a key.
// Production can never reach the state that fixture created (no key is
// ever issued to a role='owner' user — I2, cmd/issue-key.md/service.go's
// IssueAPIKeyForHandle), so the isolation assertion it built ("each owner
// sees only their own key") was real and green but proved nothing about
// the actual system: GET /api/bff/keys was scoped to the session owner's
// own user_id, a set that structurally could never be non-empty, which is
// exactly why the settings page showed every real deployment an empty
// list (GOAL.md's survey finding). I21 replaces that endpoint's semantics
// (every role='agent' user's non-revoked keys, not one user_id's own) and
// every fixture below seeds its agent identities through
// identity.Service.IssueAPIKeyForHandle — the exact method
// cmd/issue-key/main.go's own run() calls (line 123) — never a direct
// repo.CreateUser(..., "agent", ...) insert standing in for it.

// newAgentPublicAPIRouterForKeys builds a bare /api/v1 stack mounting only
// publicapi.KeysServer.ListKeys — the real Bearer-authenticated surface an
// agent actually calls in production, not a service-layer shortcut: mount
// only the routes this file's tests need directly, RequireActor + the
// real openapi.yaml request validator, the same middleware chain
// production traffic hits.

// every role='agent' user's non-revoked keys.
