-- name: ListAllAgentAPIKeys :many
-- I21 (_contract/INVARIANTS.md): the owner-facing key-listing endpoint
-- (GET /api/bff/keys) needs every role='agent' user's non-revoked keys,
-- not one user_id's own keys - the settings page's whole reason for
-- existing (GOAL.md's "Owner-facing key visibility" decision). A JOIN on
-- users from this file is a same-module reference (both api_keys and
-- users belong to the identity module per internal/dbquery/
-- tableisolation.go's TableOwnership) so it needs no ReadOnlyGrant - a
-- cross-module JOIN on a table owned elsewhere would.
--
-- milestone-4 fix-round (handle-exposure): api_keys.* PLUS users.handle -
-- my-task's own src/app/(app)/settings/api-key-settings.tsx shows
-- `{k.handle}` on every row and its revoke dialog reads "Revoke
-- {handle}'s key?" (RevokeKeyButton) - the handle is the centre of that
-- whole interaction, not a nicety, so the owner-facing settings page
-- structurally cannot do its job without it. Still an explicit column
-- list, not a bare SELECT * against the join, for the same leak-prevention
-- reason as before - this query's own Go return type
-- (ListAllAgentAPIKeysRow) is scoped to this one query only; every other
-- query in this file keeps returning bare db.ApiKey, unaffected.

-- name: RevokeAPIKeyByID :one
-- The owner-facing revoke endpoint's own query (I21): session-gated to a
-- valid owner by the handler above this layer, but not scoped to any
-- particular user_id here - the owner may revoke any agent's key, and
-- there is structurally no api_keys row whose user_id ever belongs to a
-- role='owner' user (I2, cmd/issue-key only ever issues to role='agent'),
-- so no explicit role filter is needed for this to mean exactly "any
-- agent's key".
