// I14 (_rules/_contract/INVARIANTS.md): `issue` and `rotate` both leave
// behind a key file and a resolver script, so "rotation invalidates
// immediately, re-resolve to recover" (I13's no-grace-period design) is
// actually one command, not a manual copy-paste out of a terminal
// scrollback. This file owns both pieces of that mechanism; main.go calls
// it from both run() (issue) and runRotate().
//
// The resolver script's content (resolverScript, below) is ported
// verbatim from `~/.my-task/bin/key` per _goal/GOAL.md's "Key resolver
// script — port verbatim, don't rewrite from the description" decision —
// only names changed (MY_TASK_CREW -> MY_TOKEN_CREW, ~/.my-task/ ->
// ~/.my-token/, and the my-task-specific comment references). The
// empty-argument guard, its exact reasoning, the fallback chain, and the
// 0600-is-a-rule-not-isolation point all carry over unchanged in spirit.

# The last one is host-specific on purpose. This service and its companion
# skill know only MY_TOKEN_CREW; mapping that to whatever a particular
# host calls a crew belongs in this resolver, which is a host-side artifact
# rather than part of the app. Moving to a host that names crews differently
# is a one-line edit here and touches nothing else. Without it there is
# nowhere per-crew to set MY_TOKEN_CREW at all on a host where every crew
# shares one HOME.

# An argument that is PRESENT BUT EMPTY is a mistake, not an omission — it is
# almost always "$SOME_VAR" where the variable is unset. Bash's ${1:-...}
# treats that identically to no argument at all and falls through to the
# environment, so the call succeeds, returns the caller's own key, and looks
# right. That is how a documented-but-wrong invocation once survived
# undetected on my-task's own host: a skill showed key "$MY_TASK_CREW",
# MY_TASK_CREW was set nowhere, and the accidental fallthrough made a
# forbidden form work anyway (found by tiana, reading the guide cold).
# Refuse it here too, before a fork of this template repeats the same
# mistake on a host of its own.
