// TPL-1 milestone-3/task-3: replaces task-1's placeholder (always a
// signed-in stub session) with a real TanStack Query hook against
// GET /api/bff/me (internal/transport/bff/me_handler.go,
// .chief/milestone-3/_contract/API.md). Same exported shape as before
// (useSession() -> { data, isPending, error }, signOut()) — AuthGate.tsx
// and Header.tsx need zero further changes beyond this file's own
// implementation swapping underneath their existing `~/lib/auth-client`
// import, per task-3's own spec.
//
// GET /api/bff/me's response shape (task-2's report):
// { "handle": string, "role": string, "active": bool } — byte-identical
// field set to GET /api/v1/me. AuthGate/Header only ever read `session`
// (truthy/falsy) and, in Header's case, `session.user.name`/
// `session.user.email` for display — this hook maps `handle` onto both of
// those (there's no separate display name/email on this surface; `role`
// rides along as the secondary line since it's the next most useful thing
// to show in that popover).
//
// milestone-4 hardening: `role` is now ALSO exposed as its own,
// properly-named, narrowly-typed field (`AuthUser.role`), not just
// smuggled inside `email` for display. Clara found this by reading the
// example domain module's own components (since deleted, story-1/
// ticket-16) passing `session?.user.email` into a permission check and
// concluding the argument must be `undefined` (no `email` field on `Me`)
// — a reasonable read of the generated schema alone, and wrong only
// because this file's `email: me.role` reuse is exactly the kind of thing
// a schema read can't see. A rendering test (opening the real control)
// proved the reused field actually carried the right value and the
// permission-gated action genuinely was offered for a mocked owner
// session — so the specific mechanism suspected here was not the live
// bug. It is still worth fixing on its own: overloading a display field
// to secretly carry a security-relevant value is a real landmine (it
// fooled a careful reader once already), independent of whether it
// caused มายด์'s observed one. `AuthRole`'s union type is the actual fix
// Clara asked for — `string | undefined` would have let `.email` compile
// into that permission check without complaint; this type would not.
